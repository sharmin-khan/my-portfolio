          <p className="mb-4">
            I started my programming journey with a curiosity to understand how
            websites and apps are built. Over time, I have developed strong
            skills in frontend development, especially working with React and
            Tailwind CSS. I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly
            interfaces that provide great experiences for users.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Besides coding, I love painting and exploring different art styles.
            It helps me stay creative and relaxed. I also enjoy playing sports
            like badminton which keeps me active and focused. I believe a good
            balance between work and hobbies is essential to grow both
            professionally and personally.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my work, I am passionate about continuous learning and solving
            real-world problems through technology. Iâ€™m always eager to take on
            new challenges and collaborate with others to build meaningful
            projects.
